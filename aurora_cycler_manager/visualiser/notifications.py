Notification system for the Aurora cycler manager app.

To send notification in a callback, Output to notifications-container.

To send asynchronous notifications during a long callback is more complicated.
There is no built-in or third-party asynchronous notification system for Dash.
Here we use a global queue to store notifications, and an interval callback to
periodically check the queue and display new notifications.

The interval is set to 1 second while some loop is happening (e.g. waiting for
multiple samples to upload), and it is 'idle' and set to 1 minute otherwise.
